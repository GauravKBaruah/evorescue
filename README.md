# Files and Rscripts:
Contains simulated data, R scripts for the figures in the main-text

#R scripts and simulated data:
1. `01_functions.R` is an R script that contains all the necessary functions for simulating eco-evo dynamics and also for plotting figures.
2. Rest of the R scripts are for producing all the other figures in the main-text.
3. `final_dat_evorescue.RData` - is the summarised simulated data to produce figure 5,and figure 6.
4. `evo_rescue_parameter_space.RData` - is the summarised simulated data for parameter space sensitivity analysis for figure 4.

# Datasets from web-of-life database.
`datasets_1` is the folder that contains the adjacency matrix form web-of-life.es database of 61 plant-pollinator networks.
